### What I learned

I was capable to visualize the solution before starting to coding. Still, I always have the feeling that my solution isn't the right one. I mean, this works, but can we do this with less containers, for example? 

Either way, I'm happy with the final result. I'm not quite sure about the box shadow color, but I did my best trying to match it up. On the other hand, the border top with the highlight color from the design looks straight and in my solution the boder top curves at the border of the container due the border-radius property. So I'd like to figure out how to do that.

If you have any suggestion about my solution I would be thankful.
